---Known issues for Cypress Segger DFP v3.0-------

ID:PROGTOOLS-98
Issue: Segger J-Link Commander and J-Flash Lite tools cannot read and do not write eFuse bits correctly. These tools do not fill in gaps in the hex file with the correct values for eFuse bits, and use a different read technique than the Segger J-Flash tool.
Workaround: Use the Segger J-Flash tool. To program eFuse bits with J-Link Commander and J-Flash Lite tools, manually edit the hex file so that the eFuse region (0x90700000-0x907003FF) is filled in with data. Fuses, which must not be touched,should be filled with the 0xFF (ignore) value in that hex file.
